# Composition

Ragel's DSL allows you to take these simple machines, and through some basic operators, combine those into bigger machines, and then combine those into BIGGER machines.

Note:

This is the part of Ragel that I found fascinating when I first grokked it.

This compositional technique is what gives Ragel it's extreme simplicity and combinational power.

I can't stress this point enough.
