<br>
## Goals for This Talk

1. Convince you that Ragel is worth trying.

1. Give you some intuition about how it works.

1. Show you how to setup a basic parser.

## I'm a Rubyist, since 1.6

I've been using Ruby casually since the 1.6 days, and professionally
for more than a decade.

![](images/ruby_16.jpg)

Note:

I forget when the transition exactly happened,
but one day I just found myself using Ruby for everything. It's a very
nice language.

<br>
## Today is About Ragel

![](images/ragel.png)

Note:

However, today I'm here to talk to you today about another incredible
tool, Ragel.

It's amazing. It can do almost anything.

Well, almost anything.

Actually, nearly anything related to parsing text.

You can get a few more tricks out of it but that's the main use case.

---
## Ragel Is Really Cool

If you don't have it in your bat-belt yet, you need to add it. Today!

![](images/adam_west_batman.jpg)

Note:
Ragel excels at ripping-fast parsing and processing of textual data.

---
## Ruby projects using Ragel

* Mongrel, Unicorn, Puma
* Whitequark 
* Mail
* RedCloth
* Hpricot
* Gherkin

---
# What Does Ragel Look Like

```
action dgt      { printf("DGT: %c\n", fc); }
action dec      { printf("DEC: .\n"); }
action exp      { printf("EXP: %c\n", fc); }
action exp_sign { printf("SGN: %c\n", fc); }
action number   { /*NUMBER*/ }

number = (
    [0-9]+ $dgt ( '.' @dec [0-9]+ $dgt )?
    ( [eE] ( [+\-] $exp_sign )? [0-9]+ $exp )?
) %number;

main := ( number '\n' )*;
```

## But Regular Expressions are easy!

zarro boogs found

![](images/regular_expression.jpg)

Note:

What's that you say? Parsing text?

Parsing text is easy.

You just use regular expressions, right?

Simple. No problem.

They have their place, but you can reach for something better.

---
## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions consist of constants and operator symbols that denote sets of strings and operations over these sets, respectively. (from Wikipedia)

```
   /a/         # match a
   /abc/       # match "a", then "b", then "c" (concatenation)
   /a|b/       # match "a" or "b" (alteration)
   /gr(a|e)y/  # match "gr", then "a" or "e", then "y" (grouping)
   /a?/        # match zero or one "a"
   /a*/        # match zero or more "a"
   /a+/        # match one or more "a"
   /a{18}/     # match "a" 18 times
   /a{2,}/     # match "a" 2 or more times
   /a{2,10}/   # match "a" between 2 and 10 more times
```

Note:
Most people should be familiar with the standard regexp form.

---
## Ruby has great tools for regular expressions

You can get by with them. You can especially get by with them in Ruby which draws its heritage from Perl, Sed, and Awk which made wonderful use of regexps.

```
@dot = @dot.gsub(/^.*->.*$/) do |line|
  line.gsub(/label = ".*"/) do |labels|
    labels.gsub(/\b\d+/) { |num| ASCII_MAP[num] || num }
  end
end
```

---
## Sometimes You Want More Control

I posit that this might be some sort of automaton.

![](images/automaton.jpg)

Note:
Regepx work fine. Why do we need something better?

---
<br>
## Finite Automata

* Have states and transitions.

* Change state based on sequence of inputs.

* **DFA** can be in only one state at a time.

* **NFA** can be in more than one state at a time.

Note:

But, we can convert an NFA into a DFA by making "super states" from these dual states. This grows combinatorically, of course.

---

## These Are All State Machines

<br>

State machines are an important tool in computer programming, and Ragel is a wonderful tool for creating them.

---
## State machines are everywhere

![](images/state_machines_everywhere.png)

---
<br>
## They're in your stoplight

<br>
![](images/stoplight.gif)

---
## They run your CPU

![](images/cpu_machine.png)

Note:

Every tick of your CPU advancing a state machine from one state to
another...

Take all of the bits in your computer and label each combination as a state.

Take all of the input bits and label those as different inputs.

That's a big horkin' state machine.

---
<br>
## There are examples everywhere

* watch with timer
* vending machine
* traffic light
* bar code scanner
* gas pumps
* number classification

---
<br>
# The Cat's Meow?

State machines are great for many reasons. They are simple to understand, and there has been a great deal of research around finite automata and state machines. With the right approach they can also produce code that is faster, easier to maintain, and more correct and thus more secure.

---
<br><br>
# Still Not Convinced?

Rather than me trying to convince you that they're useful, let's just talk about them for a bit and see where we end up.

---
<br><br>
# Let's go over some vocabulary

---
<br>
# Start state

This is the initial state of a machine.

(S0)

---
# Accept state

In this state, the machine is said to have "accepted" the input.

(double circle)

![](images/accept_state.png)

---
# Transition

Upon consuming a single character, the machine can move from one state to another.

(labelled arrow)

![](images/transition_arrow.png)

---
# Epsilon Transition

Allows an automaton to change its state spontaneously, i.e. without
consuming an input symbol.

![](images/epsilon_transition.png)

Note:
These can be used to wire machines together.

Composition.

Computer science.

---
# Simple Machines

  'a', 'a'*, 'a'+

![](images/simple_machines.png)

---
# More Complex

'hello'*

Zero or more hellos.

![](images/hello_star.png)

---
<br><br><br>
# What's the Big Deal?

These just look like regular expressions.

Note:
They are, more or less.

However, Ragel has a few more tricks up it's sleeve.

We're going to compose these simple machines.

And execute arbitrary actions at any point inside them.

That is when things get really cool.

Re: [ragel-users] pronounciation
Adrian Thurston Sat, 10 Apr 2010 09:02:10 -0700

Hi Landon,

I usually say something like "rah-ghel." I had no
phonetic basis for it when I picked it. I just took my nickname
"Age" and wrapped it in the R and L of regular languages. I've
since learned that it means "man" in Arabic.

# Well, darn. I've been pronouncing it wrong for quite some time!

For too long, actually. I'm not sure if I'll be able to change. I will if you do.

## Ragel is a DSL for creating state machines

It is espcially useful for parsing protocols and data formats. (HTTP, XML, JSON, CSS, etc...)

Note:

From a high-level, it helps you build regular expressions, but with an important difference.

With Ragel, you have the ability to stop at any point in the regexp parse and execute code in the host language.

This is incredibly powerful.

It means that rather than having a large program with lots of regexps, loops, and conditionals, we can have one
EBNF-ish looking definition that, instead, calls out to our code when we need it to.

You can do some really cool tricks with this.

---
<br><br><br>
# Let's look at the DSL

---
<br>
## General Structure of a Ragel File

* Mostly in the host language
* has a .rl extension (simple.rl)
* %% is used for inline statements
* %%{ is used for multiline statements }%%

```
%%{
  machine foobar;
  main := 'foobar';
}%%

%%write init;
%%write exec;
```

---
## Naming a Machine

With named machines, you can spread a machine's statements across several files or include common sections.

```
    machine phone_parser;
```

---
## Machine Definition

You define a machine using the equals operator.

```
    <name> = <expression>;
```

This allows it to be referenced later.

Note:
The machine definition statement associates an FSM expression with a name.

Machine expressions assigned to names can later be referenced in other expressions.

A definition statement on its own does not cause any states to be generated.

It is simply a description of a machine to be used later.

States are generated only when a definition is instantiated, which happens when a definition is referenced in an instantiated expression.


---
## Machine Instantiation

This causes the actual generation of the referenced set of states.

```
  <name> := <expression>;
```

Each instantiation generates a distinct set of states. 

Note:

Starting state written to the data section.

If main used, it is set as the start state.

If not, the last machine instantiated has the start state.

---
## File Inclusion and Import

You can include and import definitions from other files.

```
    include FsmName "inputfile.rl";

    import "inputfile.h";
```

These can help you keep things organized. See the manual for the specific semantics of each.

---
# Comments

```
  # is used for single line comments
```  

---
# Literals

Literals are contained in quotes, regexp slashes, or brackets for groupings.

```
  ""    # string
  ''    # string
  //    # regexp
  []    # union
```

---
# Escape Characters

```
  \0    null
  \a    
  \b    backspace
  \t    tab
  \n    newline
  \v    vtab
  \f    formfeed
  \r    carriage return
```

You can escape the end of a line with a \ (as in shell scripting)

---
# Host Language Code

Braces are used to delimit host language code in %%{ }%% sections


```
   { puts "I am ruby" }    
```  

---
# Numbers

Integers and hexadecimals can be used to refer to numbers.

```
    [+-]?[0-9]+            # integers    (-23432, +23423, 23423)
    0x[0-9A-fa-f]          # hexadecimal (0xABD)
```  

---
# Keywords

```
    access
    actionalphtype
    getkey
    write
    machine
    include
```    

---
<br>
# Whitespace

  Any amount of whitespace can separate tokens.

---
# Concatenation Literal

Both of these produce a match on a sequence of letters.

```
%%{
  machine simple;
  main := 'simple';
}%%
```
  
![](images/simple_concat.png)

---
# Union Expression

```
%%{
  machine union_range;
  union := [abc];
  union_range := [acm-z];
}%%
```

![](images/union_range.png)

---
# Zero Length Machines

```
%%{
  machine zero_length_machines;
  single := '';
  double := "";
  bracket := [];
}%%
```

![](images/zero_length_machine2.png)

---
# Numerical Literal

Produces a two-state machine with one transition on the given value, which can be given in decimal or hexadecimal.

```
%%{
  machine numerical_literal;
  main := 42;
}%%
```

![](images/numeric_literal.png)

---
# Regular Expression

```
%%{
  machine regexp2;
  main := /ab*[c-z].*[123]/;
}%%
```  

![](images/regular_expression.png)

Note:
You don't need fancy regexps because the great Ragel engine allows you to do whatever you would need here.

How many turtles do you need?

---
# Range Expression

Matches 

```
%%{
  machine range;
  main := 'a'..'z';
}%%
```    

![](images/range_expression.png)

---
# Variable Name

Inserts the machine referenced by this name.

```
%%{
  machine variable_name;
  secret_code = [0-9]{2};
  main := secret_code;
}%%
```    

![](images/variable_name.png)

---
## Builtin Machines

```
    any    – Any character in the alphabet.
    ascii  – Ascii characters. 0..127
    extend – Ascii extended characters. 
    alpha  – Alphabetic characters. [A-Za-z]
    digit  - Digits. [0-9]
    alnum  – Alpha numerics. [0-9A-Za-z]
    lower  – Lowercase characters. [a-z]
    upper  – Uppercase characters. [A-Z]
    xdigit - Hexadecimal digits. [0-9A-Fa-f]
    cntrl  – Control characters. 0..31
    graph  – Graphical characters. [!-~]
    print  – Printable characters. [ -~]
    punct  – Punctuation. 
    space  - Whitespace. [\t\v\f\n\r ]
    zlen   - Zero length string. ""
    empty  - Empty set. Matches nothing. ^any
```  

---
# Building Blocks

We have simple machines now.

Like levers, wedges, wheels, and pulleys.

But let's not stop here.

From simple machines we can make complex machines.

---
## Simple

---
## Complex

![](images/apollo.gif)

---
## Isn't She Cute?

![](images/minnie_platform.jpg)

---
# Composition

Ragel's DSL allows you to take these simple machines, and through some basic operators, combine those into bigger machines, and then combine those into BIGGER machines.

Note:

This is the part of Ragel that I found fascinating when I first grokked it.

This compositional technique is what gives Ragel it's extreme simplicity and combinational power.

I can't stress this point enough.

---
## Compositional Operators

```
    expr | expr   - union
    expr & expr   - intersection
    expr - expr   - difference
    expr -- expr  - strong difference
    expr . expr   - concatenation
    expr*         - kleene star
    expr+         - one or more repetion
    expr?         - optional
    expr{n}       - exactly N copies of expr
    expr{n,}      - Zero to N copies of expr
    expr{,m}      - N or more copies of expr
    expr{n,m}     - N to M copies of expr  
    !expr         - negation
    ^expr         - character-level negation
```

---
# Union

Matches any string in machine one or machine two

```
expr | expr
```
 
![](images/union.png)

Note:

The operation first creates a new start state.

Epsilon transitions are drawn from the new start state to the start states of both input
machines.

Nondeterminism. If there are strings, or prefixes of strings that are
matched by both machines then the new machine will follow both parts
of the alternation at once. The union operation is shown below.

--
# Union Example

```
%%{
  machine union2;
  # Hex digits, decimal digits, or identifiers
  main := digit+ | alpha alnum*;
}%%
```

![](images/union_example.png)

---
# Intersection

Matches any string that is in both machine one and two.

```
expr & expr
```  

Note:
Union the machine.

Remove any final state status from any states that aren't final in both machines.

Paths that do not lead to a final state are pruned.

---
# Intersection Example

```
%%{
  machine intersection;
  main := /[^\n][^\n][^\n][^\n]\n/* & (/[a-z][a-z]*/ | [ \n])**;
}%%
```

![](images/intersection_example.png)


---
# Difference

Matches strings in machine one but not in machine two

```
expr - expr 
```

---
## Difference Example

```
%%{
  machine difference;
  # Subtract keywords from identifiers.
  main := /[a-z][a-z]*/ - ( 'for' | 'int' );
}%%
```

![](images/difference_example.png)

---
# Strong Difference

Matches any string of the first machine that does not have any string of the second machine as a substring.

```
expr -- expr
```

Equivalent to:

```
expr - ( any* expr any* )
```  

---
## Strong Difference Example

Used to excluded CRLF from a sequence.

```
%%{
  machine strong_difference;
  crlf = '\r\n';
  main := [a-z]+ ':' ( any* -- crlf ) crlf;
}%%
```

The DEF transition is taken if no other transition can be taken.

![](images/strong_difference_example.png)


---
# Concatenation

Matches all the strings in machine one followed by all the strings in machine two.

```
expr . expr
```

![](images/concatenation.png)

Note:

There is an oppotunity for non-determinism of matches from machine one prevent machine two from starting.

There are techniques for avoiding this.

---
## Concatenation Example

```
%%{
  machine concatenation;
  #concatenation
  main := [a-z]+ . /ba[rz]/;
}%%
```

![](images/concatenation_example.png)

---
# Kleene Star

Match zero or more repetitions of the machine it is applied to.

```
expr*
```  

Note:

DANGER: The possibility for nondeterministic behaviour arises if the
final states have transitions on any of the same characters as the
start state.

---
# Kleene Star Example

```
%%{
  machine kleene_star;
  # Match any number of lines with only lowercase letters.
  main := /[a-z]*\n/*;
}%%
```

![](images/kleene_star_example.png)

---
# One or More Repetion

Produces the concatenation of the machine with the kleene star of
itself. The result will match one or more repetitions of the machine.

```
expr+
```

  Equivalent to:

```
expr . expr*
```  

---
# Optional

```
expr?
```

  Equivlaent to:

```
expr | ''
```
---
## Optional Example

```
%%{
  machine optional;
  # Match integers or floats.
  main := digit+ ('.' digit+)?;
}%%
```

![](images/optional_example.png)

---
# Repetition

```
expr{n} - exactly N copies of expr
expr{n,} - Zero to N copies of expr
expr{,m} - N or more copies of expr
expr{n,m} - N to M copies of expr
```  

---
# Negation

Matches any string not matched by the given machine.

```
!expr
```  

Equivalent to:

```
any* - expr
```

---
## Negation Example

```
%%{
  machine negation;
  # Accept anything but a string beginning with a digit.
  main := !( digit any* );
}%%
```

![](images/kleene_star_example.png)
  
---
## Character- Level Negation

```
^expr
```

Equivalent to:

```
any - expr
```    

Note:

Must be applied to machines that match length one.

---
<br>
## State Machine Minimization

* Reduces the number of states through optimization
* Merges equivalent states
* On by default (can be disabled with -n)

---
<br>
# User Actions

  Composition is definitely cool and useful. But on top of that, Ragel
  gives you embedded actions. This is where you take all the
  composition and really make it sing, on key.

---
<br>
# Embedding Actions

```
  action <action_name> {
    # host code here
    count += 1
  }
```

Actions can be referenced by name or embedded inline.

---
<br>
# Transitions

Transitions come in four classes, and actions can be attached to any of them.

---
<br>
# Entering Transition

```
  > operator

  expr > action_name
  expr >{ puts "entering" }
```  

Embeds an action into all transitions leaving the "start state"

---
<br>
# Finishing Transition

```
  @ operator

  expr @ action_name
  expr @{ puts "finishing" }
```  

Embeds an action into all transitions going into a "final state"

---
<br>
# All Transition

```
  $ operator

  expr $ action_name
  expr ${ puts "transitioned" }
```

Embeds an action into all transitions, regardless of type (useful for debugging).

---
<br>
# Leaving Transition

```
  % operator
  expr % action_name
  expr %{ puts "leaving" }
```

Embeds an action into all transitions leaving the machine from a "final state"

---
<br>
## Embedding Operators Can Get Fancy

See the manual for more information on these.

* To-State Actions
* From-State Actions
* EOF Actions
* Global Error Actions (for error recovery)
* Local Error Actions  (for error recovery)

---
# Nondeterminism

One of the problems you will run into is when the trailing match of
one machine is the same as the leading match of the next machine. In
these cases, the state will be stuck in the first machine and never
transition to the next machine.

---
## Nonedeterminism Example

The \n in ws will preven the final \n from matching.

```
ws = [\n\t ];
line = word $first ( ws word $tail )* ’\n’;
lines = line*;
```     
The solution here is simple: exclude the newline character from the ws expression.

```
ws = [\t ];
line = word $first ( ws word $tail )* ’\n’;
lines = line*;
```

---
# Ambiguity Problems

Here's an incorrect way to parse C language comments:

```
comment = ’/*’ ( any @comm )* ’*/’;
main := comment ’ ’;
```

The `any` will prevent the trailing */ from ever matching.

---
<br><br>
## This Works But It's Ugly

```
comment = ’/*’ ( ( any @comm )* - ( any* ’*/’ any* ) ) ’*/’;
```

We have to carefully exclude things to get it to match.

---
<br><br>
## This Is Getting Complicated!

But there's a solution.

Ragel lets you embed priorities into transitions to deal with ambiguity.

---
<br>
## Setting Priorities Manually

```
  expr > int – Sets starting transitions to have priority int.
  
  expr @ int – Sets transitions that go into a final state to have priority int.
  
  expr $ int – Sets all transitions to have priority int.
  
  expr % int – Sets leaving transitions to have priority int.
```  

---

## Namespacing Priorities

When machines are combined, you can get odd interactions if you
don't namespace the priorities.

```
  expr > (name, int) – Starting transitions.
  expr @ (name, int) – Finishing transitions (into a final state).
  expr $ (name, int) – All transitions.
  expr % (name, int) – Leaving transitions.
```

---
<br>
# Guarded Operations

Thinking in priorities is hard.

Fortunately Ragel provides some better mechanisms for us to use.

These are called "guarded concatenations"

---
<br>
## Finish-Guarded Concatenation

A higher priority is then embedded into the transitions of the second machine that enter into a final state.

```
comment = ’/*’ ( any @comm )* :>> ’*/’;
```    

This is much simpler to visualize and reason about.

---
<br>
## Entry-Guarded Concatenation

A higher priority is given to the second machine.

```
expr :> expr
```

```
# Leave the catch-all machine on the first character of FIN.
main := any* :> 'FIN';
```

Equivalent to:

```
expr $(unique_name,0) . expr >(unique_name,1)
```

---
<br>
## Left-Guarded Concatenation

The left hand machine has a higher priority.

```
expr <: expr
```

For stripping leading space:

```
main := ( ’ ’* >start %fin ) <: ( ’ ’ $ws | [a-z] $alpha )*;
```

---
<br>
## Longest-Match Kleene Star

This has a higher priority for staying in the machine rather than wrapping aroudn again.

```
expr**
```

```
# Repeat tokens, but make sure to get the longest match.
Main := (
  lower ( lower | digit )* %A | digit+ %B |
  ''
)**;
```

---
# Scanners

Scanners are a common thing to build with Ragel, so it has special support for them.

```
    <machine_name> := |*
      pattern1 => action1;
      pattern2 => action2;
      ...
    *|;
```

Note:

On the surface, Ragel scanners are similar to those defined by Lex.

Though there is a key distinguishing feature: patterns may be arbitrary Ragel expressions and can therefore contain embedded
code.

With a Ragel-based scanner the user need not wait until the end of a pattern before user code can be executed.

Scanners can be used to process sub-languages, as well as for tokenizing programming languages.

---
## Scanner Example

Tokenizing the contents of a header field.

```
%%{
  word = [a-z]+;
  head_name = 'Header';
  header := |*
    word;
    ' ';
    '\n' => { fret; };
  *|;
  main := ( head_name ':' @{ fcall header; } )*;
}%%
```

# Protocol Parsing

Ragel is well suited for protocol parsing.

Mapping an RFC onto a Ragel specification is pretty straight-forward.

Puma has a good example of this (heritage is the original mongrel parser by Zed Shaw)

https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/ext/puma_http11/http11_parser_common.rl


---
# State Charts

Ragel allows you to specify states and transitions directly if you desire extreme customization.

This is like programming in the "assumbly" of Ragel.

There are a few new operators for this.

---
## State Chart Example

Parsing XML CDATA.

```
action bchar { buff( fpc ); }
action bbrack1 { buff( "]" ); }
action bbrack2 { buff( "]]" ); }
CDATA_body =
start: (
']' -> one |
     (any-']') @bchar ->start
),
one: (
     ']' -> two |
     [^\]] @bbrack1 @bchar ->start
),
two: (
     '>' -> final |
     ']' @bbrack1 -> two |
     [^>\]] @bbrack2 @bchar ->start
);
```    

---
## Parser Modularization

```
    action return { fret; }
    action call_date { fcall date; }
    action call_name { fcall name; }
    
    # A parser for date strings.
    date := [0-9][0-9] '/'
            [0-9][0-9] '/'
            [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] '\n' @return;
            
    # A parser for name strings.
    name := ( [a-zA-Z]+ | ' ' )** '\n' @return;
    
    # The main parser.
    headers =
        ( 'from' | 'to' ) ':' @call_name |
        ( 'departed' | 'arrived' ) ':' @call_date;

    main := headers*;
```

---
<br>
## Parsing Recursive Structures

The general trick is to store some context about where you are in your
recursive structure, say in a stack called @nestings, and push/pop to
it as appropriate. When it comes time to fret, you can examine your
@nestings and steer the parser as deemed appropriate.

---
<br>
## Implementing Lookahead

This is possible. The trick here is to match deeper than you need, then use `fhold` to walk the parser back a few characters.

---
## Ragel Internals

Ragel uses several variables for state. You can twiddle them in actions.

* data - the buffer where you should store the data
* p    - start index in data where Ragel is matching
* pe   - end index of data (Ragel should ignore anything past this)
* ts   - in a scanner, token start
* te   - in a scanner, token end
* act  - in a scanner, last matched action

Those are the major ones. See the manual for more details.

---
## Ragel Operation (roughly)

1) starts in state 0
2) characters move it through a state
3) it consumes p -> pe from data
4) if cs is >= first_final_state (final states are last) then you have “admitted” the string

---
## Ragel Operation (scanners)

Scanners are a bit more involved, but not that much more.

1) use a stack to track states
2) use ts -> te to track where they are in a match
3) use the stack to backtrack when necessary
4) keep matching repeatedly until we are done
5) longest match wins
6) it's useful to create helper methods (emit, current_buffer, current_match(start, end))

---
## Ragel String Extraction

To pull out the data you care about, while you are parsing, you will do something like this:

```
* >mark { puts "mark the beginning a pattern" ; @mark = @data[p] }
* %emit l{ puts "save the currently matched pattern" ; @things << data[@mark..pe] }
```

---
## Host Languages

Several host languages are available.

```
    host language:
       -C                   The host language is C, C++, Obj-C or Obj-C++ (default)
       -D                   The host language is D
       -Z                   The host language is Go
       -J                   The host language is Java
       -R                   The host language is Ruby
       -A                   The host language is C#
       -O                   The host language is OCaml
```

---
## Code Styles

Ragel uses your .rl code to compute the set of states and transitions. From that, it can generate code in a number of different styles.

```
    code style: (C/D/Java/Ruby/C#/OCaml)
       -T0                  Table driven FSM (default)
       
    code style: (C/D/Ruby/C#/OCaml)
       -T1                  Faster table driven FSM
       -F0                  Flat table driven FSM
       -F1                  Faster flat table-driven FSM
       
    code style: (C/D/C#/OCaml)
       -G0                  Goto-driven FSM
       -G1                  Faster goto-driven FSM
       
    code style: (C/D)
       -G2                  Really fast goto-driven FSM
       -P<N>                N-Way Split really fast goto-driven FSM
```

---
## Code Styles Performance

Each of these has different visual organization and performance
characteristics. In languages like C, this can boil down to
heavily-optimized GOTO statements in a single while loop. It's fast
and cpu-cache friendly.


---
## Multi-Language

It's possible to have a single Ragel definition that uses import semantics to allow implementing the actions in different languages using the same parent Ragel file. See the http11 parser in puma for details (C and Java)

https://github.com/puma/puma/tree/master/ext/puma_http11

---
## Ragel in C

It's also possible to prototype in Ruby, then convert it to a C module for super speed. Ragel supports several output formats so you can do this port rather easily.

Again, see mongrel or puma for ideas.


---
## Ragel Directives

There are three main directives that do the bulk of the work.

  %%write init;    (initializes the data buffer and sets the current state)

  %%write data;    (writes out definitions of the state and transition data)

  %%write exec;    (writes out the code that processes the data buffer using the state and transition data)

---
## %%write data;

```
  class << self
    attr_accessor :_hello_key_offsets
    private :_hello_key_offsets, :_hello_key_offsets=
  end
  self._hello_key_offsets = [
    0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  ]

  class << self
    attr_accessor :_hello_trans_keys
    private :_hello_trans_keys, :_hello_trans_keys=
  end
  self._hello_trans_keys = [
    101, 108, 108, 111, 104, 0
  ]
  # LOTS MORE LIKE THIS
  # ...
  # ...    
```

---
## %%write init;

```
  begin
    p ||= 0
    pe ||= data.length
    cs = simple_start
    top = 0
  end
```

---
## %%write exec;

```
   begin
    _klen, _trans, _keys = nil
    _goto_level = 0
    _resume = 10
    _eof_trans = 15
    _again = 20
    _test_eof = 30
    _out = 40
    while true
    _trigger_goto = false
    if _goto_level <= 0
    # LOTS MORE LIKE THIS
    # ...
    # ...    
  end
```

---
<br>
# Installation

```
brew install ragel
```

---
<br>
## Generating the Ruby

simple.rl -> simple.rb

```
ragel -R simple.rl -o simple.rb
```

---
<br>
## Visualization

You can get a dotviz graph.

```
  ragel -V simple.rl > simple.dot
  dot -Tsvg simple.dot -o simple.svg
```

---
## Calling From Ruby

To run on a single buffer of String data:

```
   def ragel_parse(data)
     data = data.unpack("c*")
     eof = data.length
     tokens = []

     %% write init;
     %% write exec;

     puts tokens.inspect
   end
```

---
## Ragel Playground

I created a tool in Volt to do some basic visualization.

https://github.com/ijcd/ragel_playground

It's definitely a work in progress, but feel free to try it out.

Note:
Volt is very cool, by the way. You can do reactive programming without ever stepping out of Ruby. Give it a try if you haven't already.

---
## Demos

1. hello parser
1. args parser
1. args state chart

Note:

Walk through a generated ‘hello’ file line by line and explain what is
going on (data jump tables, start/end states, execution code)

How does it work?
