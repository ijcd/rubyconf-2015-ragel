## State Machine Generation

> Ragel supports the generation of table or control flow driven state
> machines from regular expressions and/or state charts and can also
> build lexical analysers via the longest-match method. A unique feature
> of Ragel is that user actions can be associated with arbitrary state
> machine transitions using operators that are integrated into the
> regular expressions. Ragel also supports visualization of the
> generated machine via graphviz.
