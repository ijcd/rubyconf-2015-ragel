## Finite Automata

* Have states and transitions.

* Change state based on sequence of inputs.

* **DFA** can be in only one state at a time.

* **NFA** can be in more than one state at a time.

Note:

But, we can convert an NFA into a DFA by making "super states" from these dual states. This grows combinatorically, of course.
